This example program is a state machine of a gumball machine. For extra flavor, I made the text output only include what you
would notice interacting with an ordinary gumball machine.
To run this program run it in the terminal with:

java GumballMachineTestDrive

The prompt will display the possible inputs.
Type mismatch errors are still possible for now, so be careful about special characters and strings.
