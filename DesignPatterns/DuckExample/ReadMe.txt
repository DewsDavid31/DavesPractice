This example can be run by running MiniSimulator.class in the terminal:

java MiniDuckSimulator

Although not easily apparent, this example avoids the pitfall of inheritance by
applying flying and quacking fields using the Strategy pattern. It does this using
behavior classes for flying and quacking to decide behavior in runtime.
