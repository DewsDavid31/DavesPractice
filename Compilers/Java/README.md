# Writing_Compilers
Practice programs from Writing Compilers and Interpreters by Ronald Mark

To use in terminal use the command syntax:

java Pascal {compile|interpret} [-ix] {path to text or pascalfile from Pascal.class}

the results will currently only produce a readout of tokens, syntax errors, xml representation of parse tree under -i flag
as well as cross-reference list under -x flag.
Syntax is not fully featured, nor object code.
