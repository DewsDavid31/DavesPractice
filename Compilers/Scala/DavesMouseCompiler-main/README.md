# DavesMouseCompiler
Made using template code in Principles of Programming languages partially provided by Professor Thyago Mota.

Currently partially compiles and interprets a Mouse source file using Scala to run the interpreted intermediate code.

The example given can be given as an argument for the compiler and ran as an attrocious O(N^k) sort where k is the size of the max integer used in the list. This is the best sort program I could make without any < or > comparisons supported by our class's dialect of Mouse.
